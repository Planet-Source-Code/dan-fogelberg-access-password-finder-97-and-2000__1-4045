This is a handy little routine for retrieving 
forgotten passwords out of Access97 and 2000.

The original code for Access97 was found on a 
newsgroup and I translated it to VB.  It would
not work on 2000 so I fixed that!  The 97 code
should also work on Access 2+, but I have not 
checked that.  

Do not abuse this.  This should be used only for
databases you originally had permissions to and 
forgot the password.

Use this code at your own risk!  I take no responsibility
for it.  

Use:
   Select the appropriate MDB file and then
   Click the button for the version.  If you
   Do not know the version try both... :-)
   If you get gibberish well then it must be
   the other!  Enjoy and send comments to above.
